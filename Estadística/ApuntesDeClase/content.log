A left brace was mandatory here, so I've put one in.
You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections
so that I will find a matching right brace soon.

Sorry, but I'm not programmed to handle this case;
I'll just pretend that you didn't ask for it.

return to the right one by typing `I}' or `I$' or `I\par'.

my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
